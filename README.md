# Koikatu Gameplay Mod
Mod that tweaks and (hopefully) improves Koikatu gameplay.

## Some of the features
- Character limit at school is raised from the stock 38 to 99.
- It's possible to force raw even when denied. Can cause anger.
- Lewdness drops or raises depending on what happened in the H scene.
- Everyone's levdness drops naturally, needs to be built back up.
- Stats slowly fall, need to be worked on even after maxxing.
- Fast travel with F3 now costs time.

**Warning:** Setting the character limit above 38 requires a large amount of RAM and will extend loading times. To load 99 characters the game will need approximately 10GB of free RAM (depending on the characters used).

## Requirements
Works under BepInEx with Harmony. Needs latest BepisPlugins - universal ConfigurationManager is used for mod settings.
